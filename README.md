# Probability-Calculator
This Python code implements a random ball drawing experiment using a customizable hat of colored ballsThe key components include:

- Hat Class: Defines a hat object that can be filled with colored balls of different quantities.
- Draw Method: Allows you to draw a specified number of balls randomly from the hat.
- Experiment Function: Conducts an experiment to calculate the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls from the hat.

This code is useful for simulating and analyzing random drawing scenarios, such as drawing balls from a hat with different colors and quantities, and determining the likelihood of getting a certain outcome.
